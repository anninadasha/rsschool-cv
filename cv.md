###### Motivation

*I am a beginner in IT, but I am eager to become a professional in the field. Luckily I am only 18, so I have enough time for that. The field I am especially interested in is Data Science, but I am at a too early stage now to specialize for such a special field. Therefore I take part in this Stage0 course to get more confidence in programming.* 

###### Experience

*But I am not a complete beginner. I have had plenty of practice with Python and Java and even have participated in some contests in Informatics in Germany, sometimes successfully. To add, I have learnt some basic principles of programming at school, such as OOP, Database Design Rules etc.*
